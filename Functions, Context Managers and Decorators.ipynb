By decorating a certain kind of function\n","Since this notebook is focused on writing functions, we'll only present the function-based method here.\n","\n","There are five parts to creating a context manager:\n","\n","1. Define a function.\n","2. (optional) Add any setup code your context needs.\n","3. Use the **yield** keyword to signal to Python that this is a special kind of function.\n","4. (optional) Add any teardown code needed to clean up the context.\n","5.

You might not know what a decorator is, and that's okay. We will discuss decorators in depth in the next mission of this notebook. For now, the important thing to know is that you write the **@** symbol, followed by **contextlib.contextmanager** on the line immediately above your context manager function:\n","\n","```python\n","@contextlib.contextmanager\n","def my_context():\n","    print('hello')\n","\n","    yield 42\n","\n","    print('goodbye')\n","```\n","\n","The **yield** keyword may also be new to you. When we write this word, it means that we are going to return a value, but we expect to finish the rest of the function at some point in the future.\n","\n","The value that our context manager yields can be assigned to a variable in the with statement by adding **as** . Here, we've assigned the value **42** that **my_context()** yields to the variable **foo**.\n","\n","By running this code, we can see that after the context block is done executing, the rest of the **my_context()** function runs, printing **\"goodbye\"**.\n","\n","```python\n","with my_context() as foo:\n","    print('foo is {}'.format(foo))\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","hello\n","foo is 42\n","goodbye\n","```\n","\n","You may recognize the **yield** keyword as a thing that gets used when creating [generators](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#generators).
